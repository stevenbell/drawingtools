# Fonts
Most of my graphical work uses:
* Open Sans (various weights)
* Tex Gyre Pagella
* Ubuntu Mono

But really, you should find some fonts you like and craft your own style.  Basically you need:
* a serif font (good for comfortably reading larger blocks of text)
* a sans font (with at least a light, regular, and bold weight, and preferably extra bold)
* a monospace font (for code)
